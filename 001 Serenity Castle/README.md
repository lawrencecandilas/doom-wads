 Serenity Castle DooM WAD (for GZDoom and compatible)

It's 2020.  Hell yes, I still play DOOM, though these days it's always a GZDoom variant with freelook and jump enabled, and usually with the Brutal Doom mod installed, and also on one of the enhanced difficulty levels.  Oh, I and I disable the crosshairs.

Thanks for checking out this WAD.

## The journey

I have been a fan of DOOM since the original in the early 90's.  I was too poor to have a PC at that time (to be fair they were expensive then), and had to settle for checking DOOM out on friends computers.  That is, until DOOM came out for the Super Nintendo.  Yes, it was pixelated as hell, but the gameplay was mostly there, the music was incredible, and I spent so many hours playing it.  Did the same for the Playstation version when that came out.

In the early 2000's I somehow got a program called WADED, and experimented with creating WADs, using the original DOOM.EXE and DOOM2.EXE to test.  I still have those couple WADs somewhere and I ought to find them and complete them sometime.  

But years later, I discovered DOOM source ports, then the wonderful ZDoom and GZDoom, and then the very wonderful Brutal Doom mod.

I've known about Doom Builder for a while, and a few months ago, decided to install Doom Builder 2 again, learn how it works and actually complete something in my life.

## About this WAD

When playing the original DOOM over 20 years ago, the little glimpses outside captivated me.  It made me wonder just how big you could make a level and how expansive it could be.  After learning that the F_SKY1 texture is really a a fake ceiling, and that in reality all DOOM levels are techincally "inside", my innocence was shattered and I went into a deep depression for a few hours.

So to reclaim my mental health, I started this WAD with a huge square, one corner at -8192,-8192 and the other at 8192,8192.  I then wanted to make some sort of castle, because everyone likes castles, so I started in the middle.  I wanted mountains and lakes to surround the castle, so I did that too.  Then blood.  This is DOOM, so there has to be blood.  Everything evolved from there.

Therefore ... this WAD is very large.  Very large might be an understatment--it's huge!  

Sorry, I went a little overboard with decorating the interior of the castle, and also with the rocky mountains.  
Overall, this map is designed to be fun and shouldn't torture the player too much with impossible battles, or aesthetic challenges. 
 
There's a lot of enemies in this map and you will run into horde after horde of enemies at various places in the map; ultimately at a comfortable pace.  

Ammunition is plentiful and everywhere if you look for it.

I tried really hard to not make it boring.  It's oriented towards action - while your path through the castle will not be straightforward, hopefully things aren't too puzzling.  You will need to figure out a switch or two, and two switches in the map will appear to do nothing at the moment but will definitely help you later.  

So press every switch you find.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed on an old PC (AMD Athlon dual-core with 6GB of RAM).  

It was tested on GZDoom 1.8.1 during development and works well on the above system; it does not load or run in any DOS version (at least not DOOM2.EXE, DOOM2P.EXE or BOOM).

It was designed with the Brtual Doom mod in mind, but it's not required.  With Brutal Doom v19 enabled, it runs slowly on the above development system, and gets unplayable in parts, but on a modern system you shouldn't have any problems.

You will want to enable freelook because verticality is definitely a factor in this map.  You can enable/use jumping/crouching if you want but it will not help you very much.

## Hints

- Look behind boxes.

- There are no Cyberdemons or Spider Masterminds in this WAD.

- If you get overwhelmed with monsters at certain points, keep moving and come back later to kill everything if you're trying to get 100% kills.

- Explore the mountains for soul spheres. 

- Walking over pools of water in the castle opens doors or lowers platforms.

- You'll visit the large middle room twice.  You'll have a second opportunity to kill all the monsters there.

- There's a way to turn the light on in the really dark storeroom.

- Watch out for crushers.  There's one and it may surprise you.

- The Baron of Hell block, if touched, will lower a platform, and you'll find it useful.

- After you exit the castle, head to the right towards the lake to get the BFG.  You don't want to pass it up.

- The switch that opens the big "Baron of Hell" door is outside.

- There's an Arachnotron on top of a switch.  Finding and pressing this switch will help you greatly later.
