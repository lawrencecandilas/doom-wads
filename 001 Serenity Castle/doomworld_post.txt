Welp, it's 4 years later.  I've made more WADs since then, and have learned some things:

 - Too many monsters make things tedious.
 - This level is too damn big.

Now honestly, it is too big.  It could easily be 3 or 4 separate WADs.  But, I still like the design of it.  Some "quality of life" improvements have been done to make it funner and I did some floor detail.  I am hoping the player is not as tired once exiting the castle's "front door."

GENERAL:

- I did a full sweep through the WAD and removed many monsters where I felt they were just too much and made the game too tedious.  Especially once you are outside the castle after running through it (the "front" of the castle).

- I did not remove monsters in what I call the "choke points" - a few spaces where a bunch attack you at once.  I did try to establish a better rhythm of "ambush--relax--ambush--relax" instead of just a constantly increasing stream of monsters.

- Additional ammo has been provided in spots where I was running low (and annoyed) during additional testing.

- A few secrets have been added.

- A useless super-secret has been added.

This WAD has a special place in my heart because it's the first one I did and it was fun to create some things I always dreamed about when playing DOOM in the 90's.  But I think honestly it is not the best.  If you do check it out, have fun.
