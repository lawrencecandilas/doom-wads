Lawrence's DooM WAD Collection

These PWADs are designed for DOOM.  Initially I dedicated a repo to each WAD but have decided it's better if I consolidate them down to a single repo.

Some WADs will work with the original DOS DOOM, and others require GZDoom or compatible.

I release these on DoomWorld (under the name Lawrence) and also idgames.  Latest versions of my WADs are here.  I sometimes update older WADs so it's worth checking periodically.
