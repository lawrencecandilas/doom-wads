Description             : The ruins on Fairchild Island were famous.  It
			  was believed that an ancient water shirne lay
			  deep within the heart of this place.
			  It's also a great fishing spot.
			  Another boat has to be somewhere around here ...
		 	  ...right?

* Additional Information *

In 2020 I first posted this WAD to Doomworld.com: 
https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/118758-fairchild-island

I never uploaded it to idgames so here we are.  This version has some
revisions and improvements from the original one posted to the
Doomworld.com forumm, including title and end music.

This is a big WAD and will require at least 30 minutes of your time.

This WAD was designed with the following in mind:
* freelook 
  If for no other reason so you can see all the ceiling detail.
* jumping
  Useful/expected but I think you can get everywhere without it.
* Brutal Doom
  Specifically, using the scope on the rocket launcher is expected and
  very helpful in some spots.
  But it is totally playable without Brutal Doom.

* Hints *

- If you seem stuck, find a gargoyle face to shoot at to open a door.  
This happens twice.

- A corner of one room will rise when you walk on it.

- Most, not all, switch obelisks will open doors that are not in the
same room you are in.

- You can only leave Fairchild Island in a non-broken boat.
