 Fairchild Island DooM WAD

Fairchild Island.wad - GZDoom required; uses DOOM2.EXE or compatible WAD; developed with Brutal DOOM mod in mind and very recommended but not needed.  This has a MAPINFO with a 1-level episode and ending like my earlier WADs, just start the game, or enter "MAP START" to restart.  Because of the OGG music files, and the fact that this WAD has a very large number of sectors and linedefs, this WAD is big.

There is NO WAY this will work in the original DOOM2.EXE.  BOOM segfaults when trying to load this WAD.  Use GZDoom or equivalent.

Thanks for checking out this WAD.

## Special Thanks

Update 20240524

Well, I never uploaded this to idgames so I went ahead and did that - uploaded asa frchldislnd.wad.

Before I did the above, I added title music, ending music, updated the ending screen, switched the music format from MP3 to OGG, and did a few minor changes and corrections in the map.  This WAD has no SEGS, SSECTORS, NODES, REJECT or BLOCKMAP tables - the nodebuilder was giving me problems and I turned it off since GZDoom doesn't need them.  Testing was done with Brutal Doom mod v21, so if you use Brutal Doom you should use that version.

Update 20210131

I would like to thank cuppykeks from Doomworld for spending some time with me and this WAD on Discord and providing a lot of detailed feedback.  This feedback focused on something I didn't even really test during development: playing this WAD without the Brutal Doom mod enabled and using GZDoom in software rendering mode--and this is what you'll be doing if you're looking for an experience as close to classic DOOM as possible.

The result is Update 20210131, which includes correction of a few issues (including some serious HoM's) and many changes (mostly in enemy placement but also weapon placement and playfield design) to make the gameplay less grindy if you are not using the Brutal Doom mod.  A secret has also been added.

## Story

You like to go fishing from time to time near a large lake.  Well, you were out on your boat, hit some unexpected craggy rocks, and crashed ashore on Fairchild Island.  Your boat is split in half and it's too far to swim back.  The island is rumored to have a hidden gateway to an ancient water shrine that's infested from demons of Hell.  Luckily you have your trusty shotgun ... and hopefully there's another boat somewhere.

## About this WAD

This is my third DOOM WAD project.  In this WAD I got fascinated with trying to make an ugly, decaying place.  As the player progresses through the WAD, the player will meet escalating challenges; there's a couple of things that could trick you and the way forward in a couple of places (as well as the exit) is not obvious.

The WAD is also long (maybe a bit too long), but linear after you get out of the first green-walled part.  The par time is set to 30 minutes.

I am hoping you find the combat intense but not impossible.  Good luck, and I do hope you make it out of the ancient demon-infested water shrine.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed mostly on an old 2010 Dell Precision laptop (quad-core Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM) with some development and testing happening on a garbage 2017 HP laptop (quad-core Pentium with 4GB of RAM) from Walmart.  Your system probably will run this fine.

Again: There is NO WAY this will work in the original DOOM2.EXE.  BOOM segfaults when trying to load this WAD.  Use GZDoom or equivalent.

## Hints (spoiler alert)

- If you seem stuck, find a gargoyle face to shoot at to open a door.  This happens twice.

- A corner of one room will rise when you walk on it.

- Most, not all, switch obelisks will open doors that are not in the same room you are in.

- You can only leave Fairchild Island in a non-broken boat.
