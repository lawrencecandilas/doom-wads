 Blue Fire Park DooM WAD

Blue Fire Park is a WAD containing a short challenging map for Id Software's DOOM.  The par time is 8 minutes.

## About this WAD

In my previous WAD, Venom Pits, I was originally trying to fit a level into PSX DOOM limitations (that's the original Playstation 1 DOOM released in 1995).  I didn't make what I thought was a 1500 SIDEDEF limit.  

Turns out I'm dumb and can't read.  That limit is actually slightly higher, and this time I made it.  

Additionally, the PSX DOOM engine has more than just a geometry object limit - due to limited video RAM it's necessary to also minimize the number of textures and monsters created.  So this was also a factor in designing this map.

## Notes

"Blue Fire Park.wad" is for GZDoom.  MAPINFO included; just start the game or use "MAP START" to restart.  3 Ogg BGM tracks included which affects the filesize.  This is tested with the PSXDOOM.WAD from the PSX TC and works fine with it.

With the Brutal DOOM v21 mod, the auto-generated grass and trees makes things significantly more difficult and in my opinion, fun.

"BF_PARK.WAD" is for vanilla DOOM and vanilla-compatible source ports.  MAP currently appears at MAP01.  No custom music.

## Requirements

If your DOOM handles the stock IWADs fine for the version you're running (DOS vanilla or GZDoom) it will handle this.  This WAD should not stress your system.  

Most testing was done in GZDoom with Brutal Doom v21 mod enabled; some testing was done with the PSX DOOM TC WAD.  A little testing was done with DOOM2.EXE v1.9 under DOSBox - no rendering issues.

## Hints

- You should get the plasma gun as soon as possible, and definitely before you go in the door.

- You won't get the rocket launcher until the end of the level.
