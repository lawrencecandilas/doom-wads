## About this WAD

It has been a year since I've worked on and released a WAD, and I wanted to do something basic and something that does not focus too much on decor or the look of the level.

Really, I was trying to design a level that would work in PSX DOOM's limitations (the hardest limit to respect seems to be the ~1500 sidedef limit), but gave up 3/4 of the way through, and decided to at least target vanilla DOOM's limitations.

## Vanilla DOOM compatibility and gameplay

But I was still testing and playing in GZDoom/Brutal Doom, and honestly, after thinking about about, I shouldn't do that in the future if I'm targeting vanilla DOOM.  A vanilla DOOM WAD should be tested and played in vanilla DOOM from the ground up.

Visplane count doesn't get above 128 anywhere in the map (at least according to Visplane Explorer), and drawseg cont doesn't get above 256.  

I did start testing in DOS DOOM (v1.9 DOOM2.EXE under DOSBox) but quit after while - specifically, I quit before I redid the room behind the red key, and there were some issues with the lifts and monster sizes in the room that leads to the red key.  

If you want, you should be able to load and run this in DOS DOOM or compatible just fine, but I feel like this map overall isn't going to be super fun without: freelook, auto-aim disabled, close-range aggro behavior of Brtual DOOM monsters, and the cool fire and lighting effects of GZDoom/Brutal DOOM.  

## Requirements

If your DOOM handles the stock IWADs fine for the version you're running (DOS vanilla or GZDoom) it will handle this.  This WAD should not stress your system.

## Hints

- You should press the first switch you see.

- You should press every switch you see.

- Can't go further?  You didn't press a switch.
