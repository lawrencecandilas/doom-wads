 Wyncrest Halls WAD

Wyncrest Halls is an old map I polished up for release that I think I started all the way back from 2003.  The par time is 30 minutes. It sprawls a bit.

## About this WAD

A couple weeks ago I was going through some old files and found an old file: THREE.WAD.

I remembered the filename.  All the way back in 2003, when I had dial-up Internet, I got my hands on WADED - version 1.81 to be precise. And I made a map with it. It's initial name was "THREE.WAD". I believe I was using Windows ME at the time; moving back and forth between WADED and Doom for testing was not the most stable thing in the world.

So I dusted this lil' antique off and put it in DBX and decided I should polish it up and release it after 21 years. Changes made include lining up textures, making the gameplay better with item and monster placement, adding a few teleporting monsters, and other cosmetic things. You will absolutely get the feeling of "let's use all the textures" and of a newbie mapmaker when playing this.

This was designed to run under Doom 1. 

You need to use DOOM.WAD and not DOOM2.WAD otherwise you'll see lots of checkerboard missing-texture fillers.

## Notes

"Wyncrest Halls.wad" is for GZDoom.

- MAPINFO included; just start the game or use "MAP START" to restart.

- I like it with Brutal Doom mod but not required in the slightest.

- 3 Ogg BGM tracks included which affects the filesize.

"WYNCREST.WAD" is for DOS Doom if you really want to experience it how I was working on it back in the day.

- Tested in Doom v1.9 in DOSBox, no issues. This map is easy on the visplanes.

- Map is at E1M1.

- No custom music.


## Requirements

This is not a computationally demanding map. If your device is from 1996 or newer, you're good.


## Hints

- The left door leads to a rocket launcher and you'll definitely want it.

- You need to press 3 switches, then another set of 3 switches. The second set are all together.
