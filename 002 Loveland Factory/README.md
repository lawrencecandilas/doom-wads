 Loveland Factory DooM WADs
 Vanilla Compatible - Under 100 Visplanes

** February 2022 Update: Fixed a couple of things I didn't like, some things that might be considered bugs, added a secret, and cleaned up a lot of unused sectors.

This release has two WADs. 

LOVELAND.WAD - Vanilla-DOOM compatible.  Runs in V1.9 of the actual DOOM2.EXE.  Level appears at MAP01.  This WAD is tiny (~750KB) but probably rather big for 1995.

Loveland Factory.wad - GZDoom compatible; tested thoroughly with GZDoom 4.5.0 and Brutal DOOM mod Brutal DOOM mod v21.  Brutal DOOM not needed.  This has a MAPINFO with a 1-level episode and ending like Serenity Castle, just start the game, or enter "MAP START" to restart.  Because of the high-quality Ogg music file this WAD is big (~26MB).

Thanks for checking out these WADs.

## About these WADs

After my last WAD, I wanted to try and make something that would work with vanilla DOOM's limitations.  This is the result.  It's nowhere near as huge as my last WAD (Serenity Castle), but is still has a level of complexity.

"LOVELAND.WAD" loads and runs fine in DOOM2.EXE version V1.9 (MAP01).

It has a custom MIDI music track.  I didn't test any other DOS versions or DOS sourceports.  Visplane count doesn't get above 100 anywhere in the map (at least according to Visplane Explorer).  What was worse than watching the visplanes was finding and resolving drawseg overflows.  Even though Visplane Explorer shows drawseg overflows in two corners, I couldn't get any HoM to trigger in the real DOOM2.EXE.

I'll be honest, I didn't playtest under vanilla DOOM as much as GZDoom, because I'm addicted to freelook.  

"Loveland_Factory.wad" is meant for GZDoom and compatible and has a MAPINFO lump, custom title, and an Ogg music track like my last one.

The map is the same on either one, though.

I'm considering this WAD completed except for any feedback anyone may provide.  I hope anyone who tries it out enjoys it.

## Requirements

This WAD was developed on an old PC (AMD Athlon dual-core with 6GB of RAM), and later a Dell M6500 with 16GB of RAM.  

LOVELAND.WAD was tested using V1.9 of DOOM.EXE in DosBOX.  All limitations of Vanilla Doom were taken into account.   It was not tested as much as the GZDoom-compatible WAD, because I'm too addicted to freelook.  

## Hints

- You can shoot a wall somewhere to reveal a secret.  Where this goes is now officially a secret.

- Resist the temptation to shoot barrels on sight, some may help you later.

- The switch guarded by the Mancubus is essential to progressing.

- The switch behind the red-key door opens a door, but you won't see it until you circle back around.

- When you open the blue-key door (not the one that leads to outside), watch your back.

- Generally, watch your back throughout the whole WAD.

- And your front.  Basically, watch all directions.
